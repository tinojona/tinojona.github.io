Hello there 👋. I'm Milan.

I'm a climate scientist working at the University of Oxford where I recently completed a PhD🎓 in climate computing. 
Before I even started my PhD, I had a very comprehensive education in climate physics from different universities in
Germany🇩🇪, France🇫🇷, and Norway🇳🇴. During that time, I crossed the Tropical Atlantic🌊 on an oceanographic research vessel 🚢
and spent a winter in Svalbard🐻‍❄️ studying meteorology in the Arctic with weather stations. The combination of fieldwork
with the theoretical and computational work of my research has allowed me to see the bigger picture and to better
understand the climate system as a whole. My research interests and areas of expertise include

- *Climate modelling*: Atmosphere and ocean, grid-point and spectral, dynamical core development, stochastic parameterizations, turbulence closures.
- *Computing*: High-performance, low-precision, parallel, CPU vs GPU, number formats, rounding, efficiency.
- *Data compression*: Lossy and lossless, information theory, data formats.
- *Predictability of weather and climate*: Chaos, uncertainty, ensemble prediction, error growth, weather forecasting.
- *Software engineering*: Open source, multiple dispatch and code composability, automatic differentiation, and the Julia programming language.

As a climate scientist, I feel responsible to voice urgency and hope on the climate catastrophe 🔥🌍,
both through media and in teaching. While my main research develops computationally efficient climate models🖥️,
I see great potential in interdisciplinary work to tackle other urgent problems
to sustain the health of our planet. 💚🌍
