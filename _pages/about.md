Hi there! I’m Tino, a climate scientist passionate about the intersection of climate change and public health.

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Climate Science at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/) and the [Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/). My academic focus lies in climate-related hazards and environmental epidemiology. I explore how climate change affects human health by analyzing exposure to environmental risks and identifying vulnerable populations, with the goal of strengthening societal resilience to current and future challenges.

For my Master’s thesis, I worked with Prof. A. M. Vicedo-Cabrera and Dr. A. Saucy to investigate the relationship between foehn winds, heat exposure, and hospitalization risks—research that is currently under review at *Environmental Epidemiology* [[see my GitHub repository]](https://github.com/tinojona/Paper_2025_foehn_winds_and_hospitalizations). Beyond my thesis, I’ve contributed to several projects assessing the health impacts of environmental hazards, which you can find [here](https://tinojona.github.io/projects/).

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Sciences from the [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/), where I developed a broad interest in environmental systems and worked on evaluating the [changes of the precipitation distribution and intensity and their consequences for water balance](https://github.com/tinojona/tinojona.github.io/blob/main/files/BA_Tino_Schneidewind.pdf) as my Bachelor`s thesis. Outside of research, you’ll often find me in the mountains—climbing, hiking, or cycling.

I’m committed to open science on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tinojona), interdisciplinary collaboration, and producing policy-relevant research that contributes to a more sustainable and equitable future.

Let’s work toward a world where science not only understands change—but helps shape it for the better.
